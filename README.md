*The Situation* - You’ve just been hired as a Business Intelligence Analyst by **AdventureWorks**, a global manufacturing company that produces cycling equipment and accessories

*The Brief* - The management team needs a way to track KPIs (sales, revenue, profit, returns), compare  regional performance, analyze product-level trends, and identify high-value customers. All we’ve been given is a folder of raw csv files, which contain information about transactions, returns, products, customers, and sales territories.

*The Objective* - Use Power BI Desktop to: 
- Connect and transform the raw data
- Build a relational data model
- Create calculated columns and measures with DAX
- Design an interactive dashboard to visualize the data
